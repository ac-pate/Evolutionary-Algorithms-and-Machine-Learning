## Projects

### Assignment 1: Inverse RNA Folding Using an Evolutionary Algorithm
**Due Date:** Friday, October 11, 2025 @ 23:55

This assignment focuses on developing an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) to tackle the inverse RNA folding problem - designing RNA sequences that fold into specific, predetermined secondary structures.

**Key Features:**
- Implementation of an Evolutionary Algorithm in Python
- RNA sequence generation respecting IUPAC nucleotide constraints
- Fitness evaluation based on structural similarity to target dot-bracket notation
- Diversity optimization to find multiple unique valid sequences
